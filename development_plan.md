# FinGenie Development Plan

## Overview

## Invoice Template Implementation

Based on the provided invoice template (INV#14349.pdf), we will create a custom HTML/CSS template with the following elements:

1. **Header Section**:
   - Business name and logo ("Grace WEDDINGS & EVENTS")
   - Business tagline ("Bringing Imagination to Reality...")
   - Business address, phone, and website

2. **Invoice Information**:
   - Invoice number (e.g., "INV#14349")
   - Client details (name, address)
   - Issue date

3. **Service Table**:
   - Column headers (SL.No, Service Description, SQFT, Rate, Amount)
   - Line items with service details
   - Subtotal, tax calculations (CGST, SGST), and total

4. **Payment Information**:
   - Bank details (Bank name, Account name, Account number, IFSC code)
   - Signature field
   - Thank you message

5. **Visual Design Elements**:
   - Decorative leaf elements in header
   - Cream/beige background with brown text
   - Structured table with alternating row colors
   - Professional typography and spacing

The invoice generation will use a combination of HTML/CSS templates and Puppeteer to create pixel-perfect PDFs matching the provided template.
